Thank you for the GPT4 info!

The second and third answers do indeed look pretty good.

I don't think we would have given GPT4 much credit for its
answer to the first question.

>=20
> * Spring 2022: MapReduce=20
>=20
> * Prepare:=20
>=20
> * You=E2=80=99re writing a MapReduce-based application (a Map function an=
d a
>  Reduce function) that analyzes the way words are used in documents
>  (the details of the analysis do not matter for this question).
>=20
> * You set up a database server that has a table mapping words to counts.
>=20
> * You=E2=80=99re careful to reset the counts in the database to zero befo=
re starting

>=20
> * You run only a single MapReduce job at a time.
>=20
> * Map:=20
>=20
> * Each input document corresponds to a separate Map task.
>=20
> * You program your Map function to connect to that database over the
>  network and tell it to increment the relevant count in the database for
>  each word that Map sees in its input.
>=20
> * Reduce:=20
>=20
> * Your Reduce function needs to know the total number of times each
>  word occurs in the total set of documents.
>=20
> * You write your Reduce function to consult the database when it needs a
>  word=E2=80=99s total count.
>=20
> * Issue:=20
>=20

er of

>=20
> * Answer (Original):
>=20
> The MapReduce coordinator might run a given Map task more than once:
>=20
> * either because of a worker failure or
>=20
