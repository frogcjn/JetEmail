br><br>Dear Jiannan,<br><br>On March 15, 2023, Renewal Policy communication=
 was sent out which discussed renewal policy and termination processes. As =
of March 24, 2023, you completed the renewal application process to continu=
e your housing, not terminate it. According to your timeline you moved out =
a few days after the renewal was completed, but there was no checkout proce=
ssed by the house and no termination form submitted to formally terminate t=
he housing assignment.<br><br>While OGE had reached out to offer support of=
 the termination and although the follow up to OGE=E2=80=99s email was late=
r, a termination form still would have been required to be submitted by the=
 resident to end their housing assignment. We understand the response to th=
e OGE email was delayed, and for that we apologize.  We are a small office =
working with thousands of students and because of this, we have set up mult=
iple ways to contact&lt;https://studentlife.mit.edu/contact-housing&gt; our=
 office in the event one form of communication may be delayed.<br><br>Howev=
er, as stated in the license agreement&lt;https://studentlife.mit.edu/sites=
/default/files/2023-2024%20Graduate%20Housing%20License%20Agreement.pdf&gt;=
, the termination form is the only means of notification that HRS will acce=
pt. We cannot accept an email from a department as a means of ending a stud=
ent=E2=80=99s housing without hearing directly from that student.<br>The fo=
rm allows residents to indicate reasons for termination as =E2=80=9COther=
=E2=80=9D , if they don=E2=80=99t fit into the approved reasons, and there =
is an opportunity to provide further details to explain on the form. Withou=
t the termination form, staff would be unable to process the termination of=
 your housing. If the termination form had been received at any point in ti=
me, the termination could have been processed, ending your rent-responsibil=
ity and your renewal cancelled.<br><br>At this time you would remain rent-r=
esponsible for your continued housing given that you signed to renew your h=
ousing and did not complete a termination form.<br>If you=E2=80=99re need o=
f assistance I would suggest looking into the Graduate Student Short-Term E=
mergency Fund&lt;https://oge.mit.edu/student-finances/financial-assistance-=
and-grants/graduate-student-short-term-emergency-fund/&gt; or following up =
with Office of Graduate Education&lt;https://oge.mit.edu/&gt; to see if the=
