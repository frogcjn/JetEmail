Air traffic controllers pushed to the brink

By EMILY STEEL and SYDNEY EMBER
The New York Times
One air traffic controller went into work drunk this summer and joked about
=E2=80=9Cmaking big money buzzed.=E2=80=9D Another routinely smoked marijua=
na during
breaks. A third employee threatened violence and then =E2=80=9Caggressively=
 pushed=E2=80=9D
a colleague who was directing airplanes.

The incidents were extreme examples, but they fit into a pattern that
reveals glaring vulnerabilities in one of the most important protective
layers of the nation=E2=80=99s aviation safety system.

In the past two years, air traffic controllers and others have submitted
hundreds of complaints to a Federal Aviation Administration hotline
describing issues like dangerous staffing shortages, mental health problems
and deteriorating buildings, some infested by bugs and black mold.

There were at least seven reports of controllers sleeping on duty and five
about employees working while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. The
New York Times obtained summaries of the complaints through an open-records
request.

Air traffic controllers, who spend hours a day glued to monitors or
scanning the skies, with the lives of thousands of passengers at stake, are
a last line of defense against crashes. The job comes with high stakes and
intense pressure, even in the best of conditions.

Yet the conditions for many controllers are far from ideal. A nationwide
staffing shortage =E2=80=94 caused by years of employee turnover and tight =
budgets,
among other factors =E2=80=94 has forced many controllers to work six-day w=
eeks and
10-hour days.
The result is a fatigued, distracted and demoralized workforce that is
increasingly prone to making mistakes, according to a Times investigation.
The findings are based on interviews with more than 70 current and former
air traffic controllers, pilots and federal officials, as well as thousands
of pages of federal safety reports and internal FAA records the Times
obtained.

While the U.S. airspace is remarkably safe, potentially dangerous close
calls have been happening, on average, multiple times a week this year, the
Times reported in August. Some controllers say they fear a deadly crash is
inevitable.

In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, there were 503 air traffic control
lapses the FAA preliminarily categorized as =E2=80=9Csignificant,=E2=80=9D =
65% more than in
the prior year, according to internal agency reports reviewed by the Times.
During that period, air traffic increased about 4%.

A database of aviation safety issues is peppered with recent mistakes by
exhausted controllers. A controller at the air traffic control center in
the Jacksonville, Fla., area instructed one airliner to turn into the path
of another, later blaming being overworked and fatigued. A controller at a
facility that monitors the skies above Southern California told a plane to
fly too low, attributing the lapse to being =E2=80=9Cextremely tired=E2=80=
=9D after working
=E2=80=9Ccontinuous=E2=80=9D overtime.

=E2=80=9CIf I can make a small mistake like that, I can make a bigger one,=
=E2=80=9D the
controller wrote in a submission included in the database, which is
maintained by NASA.

Many controllers are aviation enthusiasts who are drawn to the job because
it can pay six figures. Some relish the opportunity to earn more by working
overtime.

But the Times found the combination of six-day workweeks and
round-the-clock schedules has caused controllers to develop physical and
mental health problems. Many avoid seeking professional help because doing
so might jeopardize the medical clearances they need to work. Some turn to
sleeping pills or alcohol to cope. Others resign or retire.

The FAA estimated more than 1,400 controllers =E2=80=94 or about 10% of the=
 total
workforce =E2=80=94 would depart this fiscal year.

Jeannie Shiffer, an FAA spokesperson, said the agency =E2=80=9Cmaintains th=
e
safest, most complex and busiest airspace in the world.=E2=80=9D She added,=
 =E2=80=9CThe
nation absolutely needs more air traffic controllers, and growing the
workforce will result in better working conditions and more flexibility.=E2=
=80=9D

Ever since the Reagan administration replaced thousands of striking
controllers, the agency has struggled to keep pace with waves of
retirements. The problem grew worse during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the
FAA slowed training of new controllers.

For the current fiscal year, the FAA sought $117 million to train
controllers and hire 1,800 new ones.

Yet training is difficult; many aspiring controllers fail. The FAA=E2=80=99=
s hiring
plan is expected to have =E2=80=9Ca negligible improvement over today=E2=80=
=99s
understaffed levels,=E2=80=9D with a net increase of fewer than 200 control=
lers by
2032, the National Airspace System Safety Review Team, a group of experts
appointed by the agency, said in a November report.

From 2011 to 2022, the number of fully certified controllers declined more
than 9%, even though traffic increased. Based on targets set by the FAA and
the union representing controllers, 99% of the nation=E2=80=99s air traffic=
 control
sites are understaffed.

To help fill that gap, controllers at 40% of the facilities worked six-day
weeks at least once a month last year, according to the controllers union.
The number of overtime hours clocked by controllers nearly tripled over the
past decade, according to FAA data.

The Jacksonville air traffic control center is one of the country=E2=80=99s
busiest. Yet it has only 207 controllers, below the target of 298 set by
the FAA and the controllers union.

The toll on safety has become apparent.

There was the close call caused by the fatigued controller, which occurred
in April. And in a confidential safety report last year, a Jacksonville
controller described hyperventilating and struggling to stand after two
hours of directing heavy plane traffic.

=E2=80=9CWe have recently had a heart attack, multiple panic attacks (inclu=
ding my
own), people losing their medicals due to depression and some that just
outright quit the FAA because it has gotten so bad,=E2=80=9D the controller=
 wrote.
=E2=80=9CWho knows how many other stress-induced physical and mental issues=
 are
happening that we don=E2=80=99t even know about yet,=E2=80=9D the controlle=
r added. =E2=80=9CThis
place is breaking people. We need help. I=E2=80=99ll say it again, SOS!!=E2=
=80=9D

At a Senate hearing in November, Jennifer Homendy, the chair of the
National Transportation Safety Board, said the shortage of air traffic
controllers, coupled with mandatory overtime, had become a threat to
aviation safety.

In interviews and complaints submitted to the FAA, air traffic employees
warned that they and their colleagues were buckling:

One complaint described a controller =E2=80=9Ccaught sleeping on operationa=
l
positions numerous times.=E2=80=9D Another described two controllers fallin=
g asleep
=E2=80=9Cwhile providing air traffic services.=E2=80=9D
An employee =E2=80=9Cphysically assaulted one controller, verbally assaulte=
d
another controller,=E2=80=9D who began to cry, and then shoved a chair at s=
omeone.
Other hotline reports also detailed physical and verbal attacks.
Several controllers reported that co-workers appeared unstable, with one
=E2=80=9Cshowing extreme signs of mental problems.=E2=80=9D
Controllers in one location were reported for =E2=80=9Cusing alcohol and il=
legal
drugs while on position=E2=80=9D directing traffic. Another described the =
=E2=80=9Cstrong
odor of alcohol=E2=80=9D on multiple air traffic employees.
One controller who worked in Colorado and elsewhere said she consumed up to
nine vodka drinks a night to deal with trouble sleeping and recurrent panic
attacks her doctor attributed, in part, to her job.
Shiffer, the FAA spokesperson, said the agency investigates all hotline
complaints and acts on credible ones.

Controllers said they had been reluctant to seek help for physical and
mental health problems because of the FAA=E2=80=99s rules requiring medical
clearances.

The guidelines, which are designed to ensure controllers are mentally and
physically sound, prohibit them from taking certain medications that can
cause drowsiness or other side effects. The rules also disqualify
controllers with certain medical conditions from working.

One unintended consequence, numerous controllers said, is that they
avoid taking
necessary medications or resort to alcohol or drugs.

Shiffer said the agency took controllers=E2=80=99 health seriously, includi=
ng by
offering free counseling.
Ashley Smith had worked for more than a decade as a controller in the
Atlanta area.

In January 2022, an error by a controller in Atlanta caused two Delta
airliners to get dangerously close, according to internal FAA safety
reports. A cockpit collision alert prompted one plane=E2=80=99s pilots to q=
uickly
climb. In a review, the FAA acknowledged fatigue might have been a factor,
given the controller=E2=80=99s schedule had included two overtime shifts in=
 each of
the previous three weeks.

A few weeks after the close call, Smith sent an email to Tim Arel, a senior
FAA air traffic official. She detailed how multiple recent near misses in
Atlanta had involved controllers who had repeatedly pulled overtime shifts.

Arel responded the next day, acknowledging the agency faced staffing issues=
.

Three months later, Smith resigned, convinced that nothing would ever
improve.

=E2=80=9CThey are kicking the can down the road,=E2=80=9D she said.
