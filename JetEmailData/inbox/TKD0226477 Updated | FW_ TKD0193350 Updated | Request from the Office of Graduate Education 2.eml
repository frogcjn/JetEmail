ar Jiannan,<br><br>On March 15, 2023, Renewal Policy communication was sent=
 out which discussed renewal policy and termination processes. As of March =
24, 2023, you completed the renewal application process to continue your ho=
using, not terminate it. According to your timeline you moved out a few day=
s after the renewal was completed, but there was no checkout processed by t=
he house and no termination form submitted to formally terminate the housin=
g assignment.<br><br>While OGE had reached out to offer support of the term=
ination and although the follow up to OGE=E2=80=99s email was later, a term=
ination form still would have been required to be submitted by the resident=
 to end their housing assignment. We understand the response to the OGE ema=
il was delayed, and for that we apologize.  We are a small office working w=
ith thousands of students and because of this, we have set up multiple ways=
 to contact&lt;https://studentlife.mit.edu/contact-housing&gt; our office i=
n the event one form of communication may be delayed.<br><br>However, as st=
ated in the license agreement&lt;https://studentlife.mit.edu/sites/default/=
files/2023-2024%20Graduate%20Housing%20License%20Agreement.pdf&gt;, the ter=
mination form is the only means of notification that HRS will accept. We ca=
nnot accept an email from a department as a means of ending a student=E2=80=
=99s housing without hearing directly from that student.<br>The form allows=
 residents to indicate reasons for termination as =E2=80=9COther=E2=80=9D ,=
 if they don=E2=80=99t fit into the approved reasons, and there is an oppor=
tunity to provide further details to explain on the form. Without the termi=
nation form, staff would be unable to process the termination of your housi=
ng. If the termination form had been received at any point in time, the ter=
mination could have been processed, ending your rent-responsibility and you=
r renewal cancelled.<br><br>At this time you would remain rent-responsible =
for your continued housing given that you signed to renew your housing and =
did not complete a termination form.<br>If you=E2=80=99re need of assistanc=
e I would suggest looking into the Graduate Student Short-Term Emergency Fu=
