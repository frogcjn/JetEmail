e renewal application process to continue your housing, not terminate it. A=
ccording to your timeline you moved out a few days after the renewal was co=
mpleted, but there was no checkout processed by the house and no terminatio=
n form submitted to formally terminate the housing assignment.<br><br>While=
 OGE had reached out to offer support of the termination and although the f=
ollow up to OGE=E2=80=99s email was later, a termination form still would h=
ave been required to be submitted by the resident to end their housing assi=
gnment. We understand the response to the OGE email was delayed, and for th=
at we apologize.  We are a small office working with thousands of students =
and because of this, we have set up multiple ways to contact&lt;https://stu=
dentlife.mit.edu/contact-housing&gt; our office in the event one form of co=
mmunication may be delayed.<br><br>However, as stated in the license agreem=
ent&lt;https://studentlife.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2023-2024%20Graduate=
%20Housing%20License%20Agreement.pdf&gt;, the termination form is the only =
means of notification that HRS will accept. We cannot accept an email from =
a department as a means of ending a student=E2=80=99s housing without heari=
ng directly from that student.<br>The form allows residents to indicate rea=
sons for termination as =E2=80=9COther=E2=80=9D , if they don=E2=80=99t fit=
 into the approved reasons, and there is an opportunity to provide further =
details to explain on the form. Without the termination form, staff would b=
e unable to process the termination of your housing. If the termination for=
m had been received at any point in time, the termination could have been p=
rocessed, ending your rent-responsibility and your renewal cancelled.<br><b=
r>At this time you would remain rent-responsible for your continued housing=
 given that you signed to renew your housing and did not complete a termina=

into the Graduate Student Short-Term Emergency Fund&lt;https://oge.mit.edu/=
student-finances/financial-assistance-and-grants/graduate-student-short-ter=
